//The Redux store in the code editor has an initialized state that's an object containing a login property currently set to false.
// There's also an action creator called loginAction() which returns an action of type LOGIN.
//Dispatch the LOGIN action to the Redux store by calling the dispatch method, and pass in the action created by loginAction().
const store = Redux.createStore(
  (state = {login: false}) => state
);

const loginAction = () => {
  return {
    type: 'LOGIN'
  }
};

// Dispatch the action here:
store.dispatch(loginAction());//Solution

//Challenge 6:
//The code editor has the start of a reducer function for you.
//Fill in the body of the reducer function so that if it receives an action of type 'LOGIN' it returns a state object with login set to true.
// Otherwise, it returns the current state. Note that the current state and the dispatched action are passed to the reducer, so you can access the action's type directly with action.type.

//Solution
const defaultState = {
  login: false
};

const reducer = (state = defaultState, action) => {
  // change code below this line
if(action.type === "LOGIN") {
return {login: true}
} return state;
  // change code above this line
};

const store = Redux.createStore(reducer);

const loginAction = () => {
  return {
    type: 'LOGIN'
  }
};
