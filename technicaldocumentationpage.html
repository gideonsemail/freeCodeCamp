    <p>An introduction introduces readers to the report and not necessarily, or only minimally, to the subject matter. "Introduction" does not equal "background"; it may contain some background but only minimally</p>
    <p>Readers have an understandable need to know some basic things about a report before they begin reading it: such as what is it about, why was it written, what's it for, for whom is it written, and what are its main contents. Readers need a basic orientation to the topic, purpose, situation, and contents of a reportâ€”in other words, an introduction.</p>

    <header id="#HTML" class="header">HTML
    </header>
    <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.</P>
    <p> Here's some example code: <br>
      <code>
          This is a paragraph.
     </code>
    </p>
    <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>

    </header>
    <p>Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, are a way to change the look of HTML and XHTML web pages. CSS was designed by the W3C, and is supported well by most modern web browsers. The current version of CSS is CSS3. CSS4 is available, but is split into parts.</p>
    <code>
        #sampleID {
          color: blue;
        }
   </code>
   <code>
       #sampleID2 {
         color: green;
       }
  </code>
    <p>One advantage to using CSS is a web page can still be displayed and understood, even if the CSS is not working or removed. CSS code is saved in files with the .css file extension.</p>

    </header>
    <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language. It is a language which is also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm</p>

    <header id="SQL" class="header">SQL
    </header>
    <p> is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS). It is particularly useful in handling structured data where there are relations between different entities/variables of the data. SQL offers two main advantages over older read/write APIs like ISAM or VSAM: first, it introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command; and second, it eliminates the need to specify how to reach a record, e.g. with or without an index.</p>
    <code>
      CREATE TABLE emp (
      empno INT PRIMARY KEY,
      ename VARCHAR(10),
      job VARCHAR(9),
    </code>
    <p>Originally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus, SQL consists of many types of statements,[9] which may be informally classed as sublanguages, commonly: a data query language (DQL),[a] a data definition language (DDL),[b] a data control language (DCL), and a data manipulation language (DML)[c].[10] The scope of SQL includes data query, data manipulation (insert, update and delete), data definition (schema creation and modification), and data access control. Although SQL is often described as, and to a great extent is, a declarative language (4GL), it also includes procedural elements.</p>
