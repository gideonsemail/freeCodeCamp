//For example, ["hello", "Hello"], should return true because all of the letters in the second string are present in the first, ignoring case.

//Original

//Solution 1

var word1 = arr[0].toLowerCase()
var word2 = arr[1].toLowerCase()
//lowercase string inputs for comparison purposes.

for (var i = 0; i < word2.length; i++) {
  //length of 2nd word is important because we iterating through its letters to see if they are in word1.
  var value = word1.indexOf(word2[i])
  //value holder for character
  if (value === -1) {
    //negative 1 is the result meaning if not contained in the word1.
    return false
  }
  return true
}

//Solution 2

function mutation(arr) {
  var test = arr[1].toLowerCase();
  var target = arr[0].toLowerCase();
  //First we make the two strings in the array lowercase. test will hold what we are looking for in target.
  for (var i=0;i<test.length;i++) {
    //Then we loop through our test characters and if any of them is not found we return false.
    if (target.indexOf(test[i]) < 0)
      return false;
      //If they are all found, the loop will finish without returning anything and we get to return true.
  }
  return true;
