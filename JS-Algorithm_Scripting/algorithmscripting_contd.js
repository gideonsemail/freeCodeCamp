//Find the longest word in the string below
//Original
function findLongestWordLength(str) {
  return str.length;
}

findLongestWordLength("The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog");

//Solution
function findLongestWordLength(str) {
//Take the string and convert it into an array of words.
  var words = str.split(' ');
//Declare a variable to keep track of the maximum length
  var maxLength = 0;
//loop from 0 to the length of the array of words.
  for (var i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
//Then check for the longest word by comparing the current word to the previous one and storing the new longest word.
    if (words[i].length > maxLength) {
      maxLength = words[i].length;
    }
  }
  // At the end of the loop just return the number value of the variable maxLength.
  return maxLength;
}


//Return an array consisting of the largest number from each provided sub-array. For simplicity, the provided array will contain exactly 4 sub-arrays.

function largestOfFour(arr) {
  // You can do this!
  return arr;
}

largestOfFour([[4, 5, 1, 3], [13, 27, 18, 26], [32, 35, 37, 39], [1000, 1001, 857, 1]]);

//Solution

function largestOfFour(arr) {
  //Create a variable to store the results as an array.
  var results = [];
  //Create an outer loop to iterate through the outer array.
  for (var n = 0; n < arr.length; n++) {
    //Create a second variable to hold the largest number and initialise it with the first number. This must be outside an inner loop so it wonâ€™t be reassigned until we find a larger number.
    var largestNumber = arr[n][0];
    //Create said inner loop to work with the sub-arrays.
    for (var sb = 1; sb < arr[n].length; sb++) {
    // Check if the element of the sub array is larger than the currently stored largest number. If so, then update the number in the variable.
      if (arr[n][sb] > largestNumber) {
        largestNumber = arr[n][sb];
      }
    }
    //After the inner loop, save the largest number in the corresponding position inside of the results array.
    results[n] = largestNumber;
  }
//And finally return said array.
  return results;
}
